# YOLOv3 - Face Detection from Scratch

This project implements a custom YOLOv3 object detector in PyTorch to detect faces in images. It trains from scratch on a face bounding box dataset and includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training loop, loss function, and inference with visualization.
